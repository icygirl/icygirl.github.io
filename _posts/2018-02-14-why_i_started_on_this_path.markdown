I have loved code since I first started learning it as a middle school student in 2000/2001. At the time I would build simple static websites with HTML. As the years past, I began learning CSS. I started designing websites but put everything on hiatus when I went to college to study Theatre.

Back in 2013, I got back into designing websites with my husband and started on my journey of learning JavaScript. I put things on hold when I started a new job in 2015. Through out the next few years I picked it back up here there, along with jquery, but I never could focus on it. In 2018, I decided it was time to finally stop putting it off and to live my passion for coding.
